    "- **\"Everyone claims to be data-driven. I want my team to adopt this approach too, with everything scientifically proven. What are the best tools?\"** You might not need them at all.\n",
    "- \"I'm worried that without a data strategy, we won't be able to grow. We need to build a data lake, warehouse, and establish data stewardship.\" Don't let marketing-driven FOMO distract you from core business.\n",
    "- \"Vector search is the new gold standard; we need it ASAP.\" No, you don'tâ€”or at least not with the latest shiny database that overpromises.\n",
    "- \"Our company is only three years old, but we've already changed our data stack four times. Now the tech team wants to switch again.\" It might be time to thoroughly evaluate the trade-offs before making another move.\n",
    "- \"I don't want to be just a middleman between the user and the OpenAI API.\" Let's brainstorm.\n",
    "- \"We can't create our own models; we don't have billions of dollars and access to half of the internet's data.\" You don't need to.\n",
    "- \"We change prompts but have no idea how to measure the difference without A/B testing, which takes too long and slows us down.\" Effective evaluation techniques are key to speeding up development on top of LLMs; you're not alone in facing this challenge."
